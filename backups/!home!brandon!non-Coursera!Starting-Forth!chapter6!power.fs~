\ Problem 8
\ Define a word called ** that will compute exponential values, like this:
\ 
\    7 2 ** . 49 ok 
\ 
\ (seven squared)
\ 
\    2 4 ** . 16 ok 
\ 
\ (two to the fourth power)
\ 
\ For simplicity, assume positive exponents only (but make sure ** works correctly 
\ when the exponent is one--the result should be the number itself).

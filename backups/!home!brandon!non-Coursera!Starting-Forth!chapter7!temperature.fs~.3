\ Problem 4
\ 
\ a.  Rewrite the temperature conversion definitions which you created for the 
\ problems in Chap. 5. This time assume that the input and resulting temperatures 
\ are to be double-length signed integers which are scaled (i.e., multiplied) by 
\ ten. For example, if 10.5 degrees is entered, it is a 32-bit integer with a 
\ value of 105. [answer]
\
\ 
\ b.  Write a formatted output word named .DEG which will display a double-length 
\ signed integer scaled by ten as a string of digits, a decimal point, and one 
\ fractional digit.
\ 
\     For example:
\ 
\ 12.3 .DEGâ†µ12.3 ok  
\
\   
\ c.  Solve the following conversions:
\     0.0o F in Centigrade
\     212.0o F in Centigrade
\     20.0o F in Centigrade
\     16.0o C in Fahrenheit
\     -40.0o C in Fahrenheit
\     100.0o K in Centigrade
\     100.0o K in Fahrenheit
\     233.0o K in Centigrade
\     233.0o K in Fahrenheit

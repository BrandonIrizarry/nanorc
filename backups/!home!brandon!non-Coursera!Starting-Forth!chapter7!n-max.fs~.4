\ Problem 1
\ 
\ Veronica Wainwright couldn’t remember the upper limit for a signed single-length 
\ number, and she had no book to refer to, only a Forth terminal. So she wrote a 
\ definition called N-MAX, using a BEGIN… UNTIL loop. When she executed it, she 
\ got 
\

\
\ What was her definition?

: n-max ( -- n)
	0 begin 1+
	dup 100000 mod 0= if dup . then
	dup 0< until 1- . ;

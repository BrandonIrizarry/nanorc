\ Problem 5
\ 
\ Write a routine which evaluates the quadratic equation 7x2 + 20x + 5 
\ given x, and returns a double-length result. How large an x will work without 
\ overflowing [a double-length signed number?]

: eval ( n -- ans)
	dup 7 m* 20 m+ swap 1 m*/ 5 m+ ;

\ skip the part about overflowing

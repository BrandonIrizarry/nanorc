I've undertaken and committed to the [ProjectEuler100 challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/),
presented by Quincy Larson and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

This repository hosts my solutions to each problem in a separate directory,
which contains a solution in at least one language. I was initially inspired
to attempt all 100 problems in Gforth only, but lately decided to include
solutions in other languages as well (for example, Python and Lua).

In that sense, this repository is "extensible" - as I learn some more languages,
I can then augment a given problem folder with a solution in that new language.
Moreover, in this way I don't force myself to commit to finishing the 100
Problems in one language only; each problem directory is a grab-bag of working
solutions, regardless of how each one is (compiled and then) run.

Such features makes this all the more exciting. :)

\ Problem 4
\ 
\  Rewrite the temperature conversion definitions which you created for the 
\ problems in Chap. 5. This time assume that the input and resulting temperatures 
\ are to be double-length signed integers which are scaled (i.e., multiplied) by 
\ ten. For example, if 10.5 degrees is entered, it is a 32-bit integer with a 
\ value of 105. [answer]

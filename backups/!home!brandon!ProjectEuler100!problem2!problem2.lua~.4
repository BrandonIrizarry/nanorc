	Problem 2

	Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two 
	terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 
	21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose 
	values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

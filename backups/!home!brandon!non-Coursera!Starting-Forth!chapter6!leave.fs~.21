\ Problem 7
\ In our discussion of LEAVE we gave an example which computed 6% compound 
\ interest on a starting balance of $1000 for 20 years or until the balance had 
\ doubled, whichever came first. Rewrite this definition so that it will expect a 
\ starting balance and interest rate on the stack and will LEAVE when this 
\ starting balance has doubled.

\ Usage:
\
\ EXPECTDEPTH
\ Run a word. If you expect the stack to have depth n after running
\ that word, then run 'n expectdepth' right afterwards.  If the stack
\ doesn't have depth n, then EXPECTDEPTH will raise an error.
\
\ ANSWER-IS
\ Run a word. If you expect TOS to equal some value k, run 'k answer-is'
\ right afterwards. If it doesn't match, an error is raised.

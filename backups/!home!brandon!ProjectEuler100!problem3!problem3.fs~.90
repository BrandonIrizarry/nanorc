\ Problem 3
\ The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
\ What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

input largest 1 expectdepth 6857 answer-is .

\ Remarks
\ Here, we successively compute smallest divisors of a running quotient,
\ until the number we reach is prime. This must be the largest,
\ because DIVISOR correctly computes the smallest prime divisor.

Some thoughts on why we use the word ANSWER-IS:
1. We may solve in another programming language, get the right answer there,
and reimplement a solution in Forth.
2. We've done some of the smaller-numbered problems before, and we just
want to check with the answers we earned access to previously (original
motivation.)
3.

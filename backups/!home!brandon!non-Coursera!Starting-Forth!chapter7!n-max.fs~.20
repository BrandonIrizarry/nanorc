\ Problem 1
\ 
\ Veronica Wainwright couldn’t remember the upper limit for a signed single-length 
\ number, and she had no book to refer to, only a Forth terminal. So she wrote a 
\ definition called N-MAX, using a BEGIN… UNTIL loop. When she executed it, she 
\ got 
\
\ ↵2147483647 ok
\
\ What was her definition?

: n-max ( -- n)
	1 begin 2*
	dup 0< until 1- ;

n-max . \ 9223372036854775807 = 2^63 - 1 (Gforth is 64-bit, while the problem
		\ statement describes a 32-bit system)

This is a backup of my current [GNU Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) configuration.  

The files found in the [improved nano syntax highlighting files](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc)
repo are included here, for easy access.  

Also, a few of them (for example, `lua.nanorc`) may be  
slightly modified from the original, and I've added a `forth.nanorc`.
